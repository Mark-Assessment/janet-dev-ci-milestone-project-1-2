## Features
This website will initially consist of three pages:
* Home -  the user will introduced to the site and tempted to explore further. All the user stories showed a desire to either get a role in tech or find out how to use it in order to build a product.

<h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/home-trial.png"></h2>

* Courses - here the user may find courses and tutorials to further their objectives. 

    For example, Maria has limited funds, a dependent and a part time job. She has limited English and very little knowledge of how to start upskilling herself. She may find that a part time free bootcamp for refugees in Birmingham, with Saturday workshops, a viable option. 

    Andrew wants a bootcamp and can afford to purchase one and/or take time out to attend a full time one. He will find both in Birmingham. It should also be noted that these local courses, often have employment partners willing to employ the course graduates or offer intern roles. 

    Nikki wants a free one-stop video tutorial and YouTube would be a likely option. 

    Mo, on the other hand, does not seem to be on the look out or a course. He is a mature student who graduated years ago in engineering. He may find that a qualification with a government learner loan or a free computer science course will incease his hiring chances.

* About and Contact - The site also publishes an email newsletter in order to keep users informed of upcoming developments either with the site or the West Midlands tech scene. Users will be encouraged to contribute to the site, they may have suggestions, modifications or some queries about the community in general. The site will open source so that anyone, whether they be new or experienced, may improve the site, extend it or copy it for their own use in another area, by location or subject. This page includes a subscription form and an email link.

## Deployment
### Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.
